# Template_Engine--Employee_Summary

The objective of this project was to build a software engineering, team generator, command line application. The application asks for information about the team manager and members, and then renders a team.html document that displays summaries for each individual. This application was created in a test driven development process, using node.js, npm inquirer, and npm Jest.  A gif of the working application can be found below.
